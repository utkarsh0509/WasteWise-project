# WasteWise-project
Waste Wise is an innovative waste segregation system that combines Arduino-powered sensors and a smart algorithm to automatically classify waste as wet or dry. The project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the proximity of waste and a moisture sensor to determine the waste type.
